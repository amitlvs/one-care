            </h3>
            <p>Healthcare technology today is offering significant potential benefits to hospitals, healthcare providers
                and patients. Even though some of these new advances are not in form of new machines or the latest
                medicines, “technology improving healthcare” is a common theme.Hybrid operating rooms offer a potpourri
                of technology within healthcare, combining imaging, surgical and post-operative needs in one common
                setting. These rooms are designed with efficiency in mind, and with an eye toward patient safety,
                minimally invasive procedures and shorter patient stays. Asset tracking systems can now also assist
                hospitals and patients by helping ensure complete visibility over all hospital assets, as well as over
                all patients in the hospital. This too results in more efficiency, less downtime and shorter patient
                stays.</p>

            <p>
                As you might imagine, hybrid operating rooms are not cheap. Estimated costs run between $2 million to $4
                million. Hospital budgets are tight and it’s not always clear that the investment of such a large sum
                will be cost-effective.Susquehanna Health, which governs four hospitals in Pennsylvania, recently faced
                this decision and chose to go forward with the hybrid operating room. In so doing, they were able to
                recruit a specially trained cardiac surgeon, retain their vascular surgeons, and the hybrid operating
                room now supports comprehensive endovascular services. The services they now can provide put their whole
                hospital system in a stronger position.
